Netflix Titles Data Analysis and Visualization

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Netflix's vast collection of titles, including both movies and TV shows, to explore trends, ratings, and the overall distribution of content. The dataset was cleaned using Python, and the insights were visualized with Tableau to provide a clear, interactive exploration of how Netflix's content is structured and how movies and TV shows perform against different rating metrics.

Comprehensive Dataset: Explore a wide range of Netflix titles including movies and TV shows with detailed attributes such as genre, release year, duration, ratings, and more.
Comparative Analysis: Compare movies and TV shows based on various rating systems such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or user ratings.
Data Cleaning with Python: The raw dataset was cleaned using Python to handle missing values, normalize data formats, and prepare it for effective visualization.
Tableau Visualization: Interactive dashboards and graphs were created in Tableau, allowing users to explore Netflix’s content based on various criteria, such as ratings, release year, and genre.

Key Insights

Movies vs TV Shows: Analyzed the distribution of movies vs TV shows and how they contribute to Netflix’s overall catalog.
Rating Comparisons: Explored how movies and TV shows fare in terms of ratings (e.g., IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes) to see what kind of content performs better.
